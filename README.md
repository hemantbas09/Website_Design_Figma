# WebsiteDesign
During my F1 Soft internship, I created a responsive website using a provided Figma design. Translating the design into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I ensured it adapted to various screen sizes and devices. Collaborating with the design team, I delivered a user-friendly website across devices.
